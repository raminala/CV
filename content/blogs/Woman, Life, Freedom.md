## Why include a political post in a professional blog?

It is crucial to maintain a clear distinction between personal beliefs and professional content in a professional blog. This website serves as my CV and is not intended for presenting political viewpoints. However, it is important to acknowledge that the current situation in my country has greatly impacted the lives of its people. Although I am not currently living there, it has affected me emotionally. I sincerely hope for better days for all people around the world, including those in Iran.

## Why do people engage in protests?

They seek a normal life, just like people everywhere in the world.
